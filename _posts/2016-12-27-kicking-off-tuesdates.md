This is the project I've been waiting for! Tuesdates is the first (and only?) solo and self-directed project I will do at Turing. Tuesdates is the result of one of my favorite regular outings when I lived in Minnesota. It all started when 3 other friends and I decided that we were going to go on a friend-date every Tuesday. The rules were simple. Every Tuesday we would alternate who got to pick that week's restaurant, and the picker had to choose a place they'd never been before.

### Why Tuesdates?

Well, because Tuesdays are kind of boring, that's why. Even though I no longer live in Minnesota and rarely see those lovely friends anymore, this project was something we talked about from day one but no one ever really had the time to build. When the opportunity arose for me to choose my own project, I knew it had to However, if I was going to do this, I was going to do it right.

### The Plan

Every good project starts with a plan. Mine started with some sheets of paper and pen. And an unfortunate mishap with spilled Thai-chicken salad. Thankfully, my notes survived. To start, I wanted to list out all the "things" I wanted Tuesdates to do. Largely this was just a list of pages that would need to be built and the key details for each page along with one really tiny hand-sketched wireframe. This is going to be a bigger undertaking than I thought. I think I'll want to do some mock-ups to help guide me when I actually start building this thing.
