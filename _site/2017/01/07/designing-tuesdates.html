    <h2 class="post-title">Designing Tuesdates</h2>
    <p class="post-date">January 07, 2017</p>
    <p class="post-content">What have I gotten myself into. I’m creating my first solo app from scratch: design, implementation, and deployment. When I started this project, the piece I was most uncertain about was the design and user experience. As a backend student, I knew I’d be writing this in Rails and was confident in using the Yelp API to drive the search, but the design/UX piece felt most ambiguous in terms of planning. I knew what I needed the app to do but not how to help the user do it best. So, I decided to take a stab at some mockups with Sketch.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2017-01-07-designing-tuesdates/sketch-screenshot.png" alt="sketch-snapshot" class="blog-image" /></p>

<p class="post-content">I’ve never designed an app before this project, and while I don’t think I underestimated how challenging design could be, it was hugely intimidating staring at that blank white screen and realizing that whether or not users loved or hated my project rested on the decisions I’d make here.</p>

<p class="post-content">Aside from having to learn how to use Sketch (did I mention, this was my first time using Sketch?), once I set my emotional attachment to the project aside, the process picked up pretty quickly. I tried to pick up inspiration from apps that behaved similarly to what I was envisioning for Tuesdates. I’m using the Yelp API, so how does Yelp handle search? When I make dinner reservations, I use Open Table. What kind of information do I like to see after I’ve confirmed my reservation? I don’t think it’s perfect, but once I stopped thinking like a developer and started thinking like someone who just wants to plan dinner dates with her friends, the pressure eased and I’m pretty darn happy with the result.</p>

<p class="post-content">Side note- as a non-designer, learning Sketch had a bit more of a learning curve than I expected. A lot of tutorials expect a basic level of understanding. If found <a href="http://megumi.co/learn/sketch.htm">this blog tutorial</a> to be supremely helpful in getting started.</p>
