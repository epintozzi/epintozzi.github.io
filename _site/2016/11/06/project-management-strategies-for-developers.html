    <h2 class="post-title">Project Management Strategies for Developers</h2>
    <p class="post-date">November 06, 2016</p>
    <p class="post-content">When I first sat down to start writing this post, I was struggling to come up with something meaningful and useful to write about. A classmate told me “Just write about what you know. You used to be a project manager- I bet there’s a ton of project management stuff you could write about.”</p>

<p class="post-content">Of course! It’s so simple. I was trying to come up with a super fresh, hot topic in tech and the problem I haven’t garnered enough experience or expertise in any of those things yet. And that’s okay. One of the hardest lessons I’ve had to learn in the last three months is that I don’t know anything, and even once I’ve got a bunch of experience under my belt, I still won’t know anything. And that’s still okay.</p>

<p class="post-content">So without further ado, let’s talk about some project management tools and techniques that developers can use to make their work go more smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="give-yourself-a-timeline">Give yourself a timeline</h3>

<p class="post-content">Timelines are really important to keep ourselves on task, but also to help us from spending too much time on one problem. I like to create a timeline for my projects as a whole as well as by task. Sure, sometimes (often) my estimates are way off, but the key is to give yourself the timed goal for completion so you have a reminder to take a step back, review your code, and then decide if more time will be beneficial or if it’s time to go find some other help.</p>

<p class="post-content">In fact, I believe so strongly in the effective use of time in a project that I keep a time tracker, even as a student, just like most professional developers do at work. There’s a huge benefit in knowing exactly how much time something takes. Whether I’m estimating a future task or trying to decide if I can still spend more time on a problem before seeking help, it’s great to have past data to look back on. It takes a total of about 10 seconds a day to start and stop my timer, and my productivity has skyrocketed.</p>

<h3 id="create-tasks-for-yourself">Create tasks for yourself</h3>

<p class="post-content">To help manage your timeline, it can be really useful to have a task manager to keep track of outstanding and upcoming tasks. There are oodles of tools out there to help with this, but my favorites allow you to include some comments, have a checklist within the task, assign people, assign dates, and allow you to add labels. Bonus points go to trackers with columns to represent the different statuses of your tickets.</p>

<p class="post-content">Using a task manager gives you a visual record of what you actually have to do. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by large projects, but with a task manager, you know that everything is in one place. Found a bug in a different area of the code? No problem- create a quick ticket and keep going with whatever your current task is. There’s no extra cognitive energy being spent on trying to solve a new problem while you’re still working on the last one, and you now know you won’t forget it.</p>

<p class="post-content">Even more beneficial than just being an organizational tool, the real reason I use a task tracker is because it’s a lot easier to do item #1 on this list- make a timeline! If you know everything that is coming up, it’s much easier to allocate and estimate tasks. Not only that, it forces you to do project planning and design. You can’t create good tickets for yourself if you haven’t thought through a strategy for approaching the problem.</p>

<h3 id="standup">Standup!</h3>

<p class="post-content">A daily standup is fairly common practice for developers working on a project team. Here’s the thing, I think they’re still useful even if you’re working alone. The purpose of a standup is to take just a couple minutes to quickly reflect on what you did yesterday, what you need to do today, and if you have any blockers. The is awesome for team work. We’re all touching different parts of the project and getting that daily recap keeps everyone in the loop.</p>

<p class="post-content">The blockers are key though. It’s pretty obvious why this is helpful in a group dynamic- I can’t move on to my next task until you finish up your last one. But sometimes blockers are not blockers because of others. Sometimes you are your own blocker. Did you work on the same item for 6 hours yesterday when you’d only estimated 1? I think one of single biggest challenges I’ve seen in projects is the stubbornness to recognize when you are your own blocker. Going back to my favorite tip about keeping a timeline, it’s really important to recognize when you’ve spent too much time on something and need to find outside help. It is SO HARD to admit that sometimes. Or maybe you feel thiiiiiis close. Guess what? If you were that close, you probably would’ve figured it out 4 hours ago. Go find help.</p>

<p class="post-content">Bringing this back around to the daily standup, you can do this alone. Take 5 minutes every day to reflect on what you accomplished in the last day, what you need to accomplish today, and where you might have some blockers. This is such an important part of planning and time keeping. If your estimates were all wrong, now is a great time to reset your own expectations and rewrite a timeline that will work. If you’re wrong again, that’s okay. You have another standup tomorrow morning to try again.</p>

<h3 id="tools-for-the-job">Tools for the job</h3>

<p class="post-content">I can’t leave you without a list of some great tools to help you reach project management greatness in your own projects. I’m just listing a couple of my personal favorites but there are TONS of tools out there to accomplish these objectives, so if you don’t like any of these, go find your own!</p>

<h4 id="time-keeping-with-harvest">Time Keeping with Harvest</h4>

<p class="post-content">I LOVE using <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to track to my time. You can sign up for a free 30 day trial, but for personal use, there is a free plan you can continue to use beyond the 30 day mark. Harvest let’s you create clients, projects, people, tasks, and budgets. It also has some pretty robust reporting built in which makes it really easy to reference past data. It also has an app you can install on your Mac or phone so you can manage your time without even having to navigate to the web app.</p>

<h4 id="task-tracking-tools">Task Tracking Tools</h4>

<p class="post-content">There are way too many task trackers to count. Many of these tools can also integrate with each other and with tools like Github and Slack which streamlines projects even more. A few that I’ve used and like:</p>

<p class="post-content"><a href="https://waffle.io/">Waffle</a> is one I started using recently. I wish it had checklists within cards, but otherwise, it’s hard to find things not to like about Waffle. It integrates directly with Github issues which makes it ideal for team situations.</p>

<p class="post-content"><a href="https://www.getdonedone.com/">DoneDone</a> isn’t as strong at full project planning but does a great job with keeping track of small tickets and fixes- like all those last minute bugs and tweaks you keep finding. One of its biggest drawbacks is that tickets appear in one long list so it’s hard to visualize different phases of a project.</p>

<p class="post-content"><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is similar to Waffle in that it’s a card based task manager with columns. The thing I love most about Trello is the ability to add a checklist within a card to help keep track of items that aren’t quite big enough to warrant a whole card for themselves.</p>

<p class="post-content"><a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal*</a>  comes with an asterisk because this tool is super powerful, but unless you know how to harness all it’s capabilities, there are probably better options for your. I’ll let you discover those capabilities on your own. That said, this can be a really super tool for large agile-style projects.</p>
